📄 File Integrity Checker
A simple and practical Python GUI tool to monitor file integrity. It uses SHA-256 hashing to detect any changes in files and ensures they remain untouched.

🚀 Features
Add and track multiple files

Calculate and compare file hashes

Detect modified or missing files

Save and load hash records (.json)

User-friendly interface built with Tkinter

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.7+

tkinter (comes with Python)

No extra modules needed (uses built-in hashlib and json)

🧪 How It Works
Add files you want to monitor.

The app calculates and stores SHA-256 hashes.

You can later recheck the integrity — it will tell you if a file is changed or missing.
